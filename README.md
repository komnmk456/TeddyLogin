# TEDDY &middot; ![CI](https://github.com/ElCholoGamer/userlogin/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

This is the source code for the [UserLogin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/userlogin.80669/) Minecraft plugin.

## Building the plugin

There aren't really any requirements besides having Java and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed on your
computer.

To install `lib/FastLogin.jar`, a required dependency, run:

```bash
$ mvn initialize
```

To build the .jar file, run:

```bash
$ mvn package
```

(I think it's that simple)
